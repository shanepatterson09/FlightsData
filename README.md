# Udacity Capstone Project analyzing domestic flight data for the United States
I was tasked with selecting a dataset to conduct exploratory and explanatory analysis.  I used univariate, bivariate and multi-variate models, with various visual types, to dig into the data.
#### I explored a dataset collected by the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) on all domestic flights. The particular data sets I chose are from 1988 and 2008 and contains 29 separate variables. I want to see how much has changed, or possibly stayed the same after 20 years, regarding flying. Also, 2008 is the most recent data available and will be the most accurate when comparing to today's data.

### Exploration Summary
- I had some assumptions going into my exploration of the flights data and I was quite surprised on a number of them. After comparing the 1988 and 2008 datasets at the initial part of my exploration, I decided for dig deeper into the 2008 dataset, as they were both very similar. Probably the biggest thing that surprised me, despite how often you hear about delays at the airport, is that flights in 2008 on average are departing and arriving a few minutes early.
- Another aspect of the analysis that surprised me was how little weather delays affected the total data set. I am from Michigan so I'm accustomed to weather delaying things during the winter months; however, Weather Delays only accounted for 1.5% of all delays in the 2008 data set.
- Going in, I just assumed that a longer flight meant the delays could be quite extensive; however, I found that to be quite the opposite. The highest average of delay times come from flights less than 750km. There are many factors that can go into causing a delay. It's possible that airlines have just failed to attack this problem due to a lack of demand to correct it. Perhaps consumers aren't as concerned about leaving a few minutes late when their total flight time is only two hours. This if of course just one perspective when looking at this specific analysis.
- In summary, despite huge technological advances in the world, many things about air travel have remained the same. I'd be interested to dig into a 2019 flight dataset; however, 2008 was the last one available on the RITA website. Safety is the main concern for air travel; if we're able to average arriving a few minutes early, I'd consider that a huge success.
